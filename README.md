# GIP

GIP isn't PHP Code Genie

GIP provides some stub code around pre-existing data.  It provides basic PHP CRUD for a number of databases.

## Install

* Clone the GitHub repository or download the current ZIP archive to your web server's root directory (/var/www by default).
* Run 'install.sh' to put your hostname and path information into effect.
* Verify the settings in common/gipConfiguration.php are correct.
   
## Getting Started

Connect to GIP, and provide the login details for your database.
Select the 'Beginning Programmer' tab to generate a basic application.
NOTE: Advanced option is broken in this release.
