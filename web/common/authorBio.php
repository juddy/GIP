<h2>A Message from the Author</h2>
Hello PCGer,<br><br>

My name is <a href="http://nilesh.dosooye.com/myself/" target="_blank">Nilesh Dosooye</a> and I designed phpCodeGenie. I started working on phpCodeGenie in 2002. It evolved from a very simple basic application in versions 1, to generate more complex things in version 2 and finally it all worked up to this version 3. As for the PCG framework, I developed that after numerous discussions with my colleague, Momodou Sanyang, which I am very thankful, for the many design principles that he taught me. I hope that you will enjoy all the features of this new version.
<br><br>
I was born and raised in the <a href="http://nilesh.dosooye.com/mauritius/" target="_blank">island of Mauritius</a>. I came to the US for studies and did my Bachelors and Masters in <a href="http://www.cs.olemiss.edu" target="_blank">Computer Science</a> at the <a href="http://www.olemiss.edu" target="_blank">University of Mississippi</a>. I started coding in <a href="http://www.php.net/" target="_blank">PHP</a> in 1997 when I was working for SAIR Linux Cerfication and since then I have been hooked on to PHP. Even though at my work, I code mostly in Java, PHP is still my first love :) Hopefully, with PHP5, PHP will start to get used more for enterprise level applications and get adopted by more companies.
<br><br>
I have used the <a href="http://www.zend.com" target="_blank">Zend PHP IDE</a> during my development of phpCodeGenie. I dont think I would have been able to develop an object oriented application of this scale without the help of an IDE. I tried many and Zend is the one that I chose to go with. While developing, a site I went to often for utilities is <a href="http://nileshd.users.phpclasses.org" target="_blank">phpClases</a>, where you can an array of so many php classes. Also, the montly issues of <a href="http://www.phparch.com" target="_blank">phpArchitect magazine</a> brought many new development perspectives.
<br><br>
I am very busy with my work and development of other open source projects. Hence, I do not have too much time for individual support for this application. I will try to write up as much documentation as I can to make things as easy for you to figure out. The <a href="" target="_blank">help forums</a> have been very active and many very kind users have been helping others out. Please use the forum for support. Also if you fixed a problem or figured out a way to do things differently, please be kind and <a href="<? echo PAGE_SOURCEFORGE_SUBMIT_A_DOCUMENTATION_URL ?>" target="_blank">write up a piece of documentation</a> and help the project documentation grow.
<br><br>
I have designed this version of phpCodeGenie to be very extensible so that you can add your own plugin to it. It is very easy to write a plugin for phpCodeGenie. Take a break from your work and <a href="<? echo PAGE_SOURCEFORGE_PLUGIN_DEVELOPMENT_URL; ?>?print=y">write a PCG plugin</a>. Its a great way to give back something to the Open Source Community.
<br><br>
Development on new features for phpCodeGenie is ongoing. As I find out more of my own development needs and <a href="<? echo PAGE_SOURCEFORGE_SUBMIT_A_BUG_URL ?>" target="_blank">get bug reports from you</a>, I try to incorporate them in future releases.
<br><br>
I hope that you enjoy phpCodeGenie and that it eases your development as it does for mine.
<br><br>
<a href="<? echo PAGE_SOURCEFORGE_FEEDBACK_URL; ?>?print=y">Please feel free to send me your comments, criticisms and suggestions to make phpCodeGenie better.</a>
<br><br>
Thanks,<br>
Nilesh
