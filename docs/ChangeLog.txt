ChangeLog

             Added tool to Translate PCG user Interface and save new language File
10/18/2004 - César Guirao Robles reported a security risk in PCG simple application generation. If users put arbitrary code in the headers and footers, they can execute these code by going to the web/generatedCode/simple/applicationName            
             Although PCG is an application used for developers and as such should not be put on production or public machine, I decided to remove the custom header and footer textbox from the full simple applicaiton generation to prevent this
10/15/2004 - Fixed XML Output filter.. it had a bug which would not cause the data not to show up
   
-------------

10/13/2004 - In searchTable DAO, if result not found, return empty Results Info instead of false (to be more consistent with the returns)
