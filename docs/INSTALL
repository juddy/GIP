Instllation of phpCodeGenie
More details on installation can be found at http://phpcodegenie.sourceforge.net/installation.php

********
Step 1 : Unpack the tarball or zip file that you download to a directory viewable by your web server

     Windows System 
          C:\path\unzip phpCodeGenie.zip 

     *nix System
          % tar -xzvf phpCodeGenie.tar.gz

********
Step 2 : Make the genie Configuration file viewable to all files in your PCG application 

     There are two ways to do that

        Solution 1 : In your unpacked phpCodeGenie directory, there is an .htaccess file in the root. Edit that file and change the path to point to the app/settings folder of your phpCodeGenie application. That will make all files in the settings directory viewable by all files in PCG.

        if Solution 1 is not enabled on your server (.htaccess not enabled)

        Solution 2 : Copy the app/settings/genieConfiguration.inc.php to your phpInclude directory. That would make it viewable to any application on your server though.


********
Step 3 : Edit the genieConfiguration.inc.php file to reflect your server settings. 

        If Solution 1 from above was used, then edit the genieConfiguration.inc.php file in the app/settings folder or if Solution 2 was used, then edit the genieConfiguration.inc.php file in your php Include directory.

********
Step 4 : Change the GeneratedCode Directory to writeable by the WebServer

        *nix systems
        % chmod -R 777 web/generatedCode/

        Windows Systems
        Right click on properties of the web/generatedCode folder and make sure the Read Only is not checked.

********
Step 5 : Point your browser to phpCodeGenie and you are ready to go.
